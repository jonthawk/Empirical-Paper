   - Do we have cost params?
   - What to do for the cost-side? Help help help...
     Maybe we just run it without IVs, and check to see if we can recover. Time to move on...

   - Brand-specific dummies, if possible (see Nevo 2000)
     + If we do brand specific dummies, we need minimum-distance procedure to identify
       all params. Chamberlain 1982... Maybe not...
  


   - Params is assumed to be length K+1, but if we have non-random characteristics,
     this will result in indeterminacy... The variance params for non-rand chars
     will not affect the moment condition, and this will cause problems.

       NOT currently have this capacity...

    - Since prices are so small relative to income, we assume quasi-linear utility
      
    - Need to resolve how to think about OO. OO has no price, share defined implicitly
      I think we prefer to add OO to the data, with 0 price and 0 for all characteristics
      In fact, its characteristics are irrelevant because in cond_share function, mu[0]=0 
      and delta[0] is also normalized to 0 in the end. The only remaining thing is to 
      remember to trim OO when doing various manipulations (e.g. calculating markups)
