    7) P0: Label giving instructions on how to generate a
         distribution of consumers given demand_params
    8) NS: The number of draws from P0, ("Consumers in the market") 
         Note: It seems like this ought to be the number of

    ++++++++
    - We need to consider how to think about price sensitivity.
      in BLP log specification, price/share derivative has a alpha/(y - p) term
      When y is significantly larger than p (as in the case of beer and other 
      retail products), this means that alpha must be extremely large, otherwise
      consumers just don't care about prices at all... It's not clear whether this
      is actually problematic (alpha = 1000?) but super small ds/dp implies super
      large markups - possibly implying negative MC, which is bad! 

    - Problem? - alpha can't go above about 65, otherwise mu becomes large 
      and exp(mu) -> \inf, everything explodes. 

    - Need to resolve how to think about OO. OO has no price, share defined implicitly
      I think we prefer to add OO to the data, with 0 price and 0 for all characteristics
      In fact, its characteristics are irrelevant because in cond_share function, mu[0]=0 
      and delta[0] is also normalized to 0 in the end. The only remaining thing is to 
      remember to trim OO when doing various manipulations (e.g. calculating markups)
